## All code was pretty much pulled from progmem's Switch-Fightstick
https://github.com/progmem/Switch-Fightstick

## And inspiration from shinyquagsire23's Splatoon printer
https://github.com/shinyquagsire23/Switch-Fightstick

TESTED ON ARDUINO UNO R3
NO CFW REQUIRED
WORKS WHILE DOCKED

Pretty much the same as shinyquagsire23's install instructions

The script currently requires you have more than 1 profile
The script will wait 1 minute before starting the raid

1) Boot up the game

2) Save in front of the den you want to host, facing the den
